## Project Goal
The overall goal of this project is to predict units sold based on prices and potentially other features using the Dominick's dataset. We aim to explore the relationship between pricing and sales in the context of the cigarette category.

## Prerequisites
The necessary Python packages required for this project are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. They can be installed using the following command:

```
pip install requirements.txt
```

## Data

The dataset used in this project is the Dominick's dataset, which is available at [Dominick's dataset](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/research/kilts/research-data/dominicks). We focused our analysis on the 'Cigarettes' category from the Dominick's dataset. To facilitate processing due to the dataset's large size, we have worked with a sliced version, limited to one store only.

The data manual and codebook can be found at [Data Manual](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/research/kilts/research-data/-/media/enterprise/centers/kilts/datasets/dominicks-dataset/dominicks-manual-and-codebook_kiltscenter.pdf). It contains comprehensive information about the dataset, including the data structure, variables, and their descriptions.
